# Abacus

Simple telemetry for CLI applications.

## Goals

* Flexibility: should be able to capture and analyse data to satisfy most questions
* Cheap to run: aim is to keep within [GCP's always free tier](https://cloud.google.com/free/docs/gcp-free-tier#always-free) for [Batect](https://github.com/batect/batect)
* Privacy: should not capture any sensitive information about the user or their environment
